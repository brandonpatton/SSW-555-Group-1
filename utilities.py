        This function loops through the list of families provided through the function call and stores
        the list of children ids, the husband id, and the wife id of one family at each iteration.
        On the same iteration, also finds the death dates of each parent if applicable with the use
        of a helper function called "findParentDeath". After getting this information, on the same
        iteration the function then loops through the now collected list of child ids and finds one child's
        birthday per iteration.  The birthday stored is then converted to datetime object format.
        The program then checks if the husband's or wife's death date indeed exists and if so converts
        this death date to datetime object format, and then does the
        appropriate comparison between the stored child birthdate and the specific parent death date.
        If the mother's death date predates the child's birthday, this is an anomaly and the program prints
        an according error message and collects the problematic child id in a list called "output".  If the father's
        death date predates 9 months before the child was born, this is an anomaly and the program prints
        an according error message and collects the problematic child id in a list called "output".  Once the function
